      <div class="panel-content">
        An extradition is the removal of a convicted fugitive from a requested
        state to the state where they had committed the crime and where they
        will face trial. For example, if a man named Bob killed someone in
        California and is currently in Georgia, he must be extradited back to
        California where he will face trial.

      <div class="panel-content">
        Hong Kong is a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of
        China on the eastern Pearl River Delta of the South China Sea. It has a
        total population of 7.451 million as of 2018. It was once occupied by
        Great Britain during the 1860s for a century and a half. Britain made a
        deal with China that they’d return the territory back to China with the
        agreement that China would allow Hong Kong to be autonomous and China
        wouldn’t wouldn’t impose its government on Hong Kong for 50 years. This
        would be known as the “one country, two systems” policy.

      >
      <div class="panel-content">
        When Britain ceded its control from Hong Kong, China agreed to govern
        Hong Kong under the principle of "one country, two systems", allowing
        Hong Kong to be autonomous, except in foreign and defence affairs for 50
        years; therefore, Hong Kong has its own legal system, where their rights
        including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected. Currently,
        there’s been a lot of tension between the two regions and lot’s of
        internal conflicts, further escalated by China becoming more extreme on
        its authoritarian rule.

      <div class="panel-content">
        Carrie Lam is the 4th and current chief executive of Hong Kong. She
        sparked one of the biggest political crises in the territory in decades
        by pushing a bill that would allow extraditions to China. Currently, her
        approval ratings in Hong Kong are a measly 9.1%, mainly because of her
        handling of the Covid-19 outbreak and the Hong Kong protests. Trust in
        the government is non-existent with the rise of anti-government
        movements and protests in Hong Kong, and Carrie Lam is not making it any
        better.

        It’s a revolution about being able to freely express your opinions.
        Hundreds of walls have been covered in sticky notes where people can
        engage with the notes by reading, creating messages, or converse with
        other people. Even with all the anti-government protests and movements,
        there are still many sticky notes opposing these movements, however, the
        citizens have agreed to not cover or take these down because the walls
        are an exercise of democracy and freedom of speech.

        >Why do the protestors carry umbrellas?</label
      >
      <div class="panel-content">
        The protestors carry umbrellas for a multitude of reasons, however, the
        main reason is that it provides protection and can be used as a tool of
        self-defense, especially from the police. Besides self-defense and
        protection, the tool can also be used as a way to shield the protesters’
        faces, providing privacy. Elsa Chan says it best, “It covers up our
        faces because there are many people taking photos of us and sending to
        the Communist Party, so this umbrella protects our privacy. There are
        cameras outside the police headquarters, so we want to shield our
        identity.” Furthermore, the umbrellas can be used as an expression of
        art and a symbol of resistance and a staple of the anti-government
        demonstrations.

        >Historically, Hong Kong belongs to China, and the “one country, two

        extradition bill if it’s inevitable?</label
      >
      <div class="panel-content">
        Even if it’s inevitable, the Hongkongers are determined to continue
        fighting, even if there’s a good chance that they’ll inevitably end up
        being part of China again. This is because they don’t want this to
        happen without them putting up a fight because at the end of the day,
        whether the protests were successful or not, they’ll be put down in
        history as a determined group of people who fought for their rights and
        their future. Furthermore, they’ve been a culturally segregated group of
        people for decades who were able to live under an autonomous government.
        There’s no telling how they as a group will be treated, especially in a
        country that’s extremely authoritarian. The people of Hong Kong aren’t
        happy about losing their freedoms, democracy, and justice, therefore,
        they want to at least put up a fight against the government, some even
        writing their own wills before going out to protest. Moreover, they have
        nearly 27 years before the “One Country, Two System” Policy ends, so
        there’s no telling what’ll happen in the future. If they have time,
        they’ll keep pushing, and even after the policy ends and they’re still
        denied their rights, they’ll still continue to fight.

      <div class="panel-content">
        The U.S. government’s response to the Hong Kong protests have been
        lackluster, with the U.S. not making a strong stance on the matter.
        President Trump has made vague statements about the Hong Kong protests,
        stating that if President Xi Jinping “sat down with the protesters, he’d
        work it out in 15 minutes.” Some sources say this might be because Trump
        promised Xi that the U.S. would remain silent during the protests. Trump
        has signed a bill that went into effect on November 27, 2019, known as
        the Human Rights and Democracy Act, which mandates an annual review to
        check if Hong Kong has enough autonomy to justify special status with
        the US. If China undermines the city's rights and freedoms, the US could
        revoke the special trading status it has granted the territory.

        Many countries have stayed silent and neutral in response to the Hong
        Kong protests as China has a low tolerance level for disagreement and
        criticism. For example, the NBA discouraged players from commenting on
        Chinese Policy after China had blacklisted the Rockets and refused to
        broadcast 2 NBA games in China when Darly Morey, the general manager of
        the Houston Rockets, tweeted his support for Hong Kong. Furthermore,
        many countries, including the U.S., have avoided taking strong stances
        on the Hong Kong protests to ensure positive trade negotiations because
        China is a major trade partner for many countries.
