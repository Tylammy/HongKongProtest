        The protests started because an accused Hong Kong man killed his
        pregnant girlfriend while on vacation in Taiwan. Because Taiwan and Hong
        Kong don’t have an extradition agreement, the government was unable to
        send him back to Taiwan to face trial. Hong Kong’s government proposed
        an extradition agreement where suspects would be sent back to Taiwan and
        tried for their crimes, however, this would also allow extradition in
        mainland China. This bill threatens to give China more power over Hong
        Kong because the bill exposes anyone in Hong Kong to China’s criminal
        justice system, could endanger dissidents, and potentially be used to
        target activists and journalists.

                  Carrie Lam's government introduced plans for changes to
                  legislation that would allow for criminal suspects to
                  potentially be extradited to China.

                  Carrie Lam reiterated that the extradition bill was "dead" and
                  that government work on it had been a “total failure”, urging
                  protesters to stop their actions. However, she still refrained
                  from fully withdrawing the bill.

                  Demonstrators were attacked at a train station after returning
                  from protesting by dozens of men wearing masks and white
                  T-shirts, some armed with poles, in the Yuen Long
                  neighborhood. The police were slow to respond and this sparked
                  a massive backlash against the police as there was speculation
                  that the police were cooperating with criminal gangs.

                  tear gas and rubber bullets was the norm so many protesters
                  were wearing masks and protective gear at every demonstration.

                  Protesters tried to bring the city to a halt by staging a

                  shopping malls and blocking roads and rail lines in seven

                  dying down. The police fired tear gas at protesters in
                  enclosed railway stations. That Sunday, a woman protester was
                  shot in her eye and became a symbol of the protest movement.

                  Carrie Lam finally announced that she would withdraw the
                  highly controversial extradition bill which had started the
                  protests, however, her opponents said it was too little, too
                  late.

                  The government invoked a colonial-era law, the Emergency
                  Regulations Ordinance, to enforce a ban on face coverings at
                  larger public gatherings and in public. The announcement
                  provoked a strong reaction and led to clashes. Hong Kong
                  became a tear gas-engulfed battlefield as protesters clashed
                  with riot police officers in at least nine districts.

                  Chow Tsz-lok, a 22-year-old university student, died several
                  days after falling from the third to the second floor of a
                  parking garage lot near where the police clashed with
                  protesters on November 4. His death is the first student death
                  during the protests. The circumstances of his death are
                  unclear, however, reports say he fell trying to escape the
                  tear gas and fleeing from the police. Thousands of Protesters
                  gathered across the city, taking part in memorial events and
                  protests across the city that Friday. Thousands of people left
                  flowers at the spot in which he fell at the car park. The
                  following Monday, violent clashes paralyzed the city. Across
                  the city, a man was set on fire after an argument with
                  protesters.

                  Citywide protests erupted after riot police stormed the campus
                  of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Hong Kong universities
                  became the centers of especially large protests in November
                  after the death of a student, Chow Tsz-lok. Across the area,
                  protesters abandoned their strategy of spontaneous
                  demonstrations and began occupying several university
                  campuses. Protesters at the Chinese University of Hong Kong
                  disrupted traffic near University Station by throwing objects
                  onto railway tracks. Police responded by firing rounds of tear
                  gas in the campus, while the protesters responded with petrol
                  bombs, slingshots and arrows. One officer was hit in the leg
                  with an arrow. Police trapped the protestors, mainly made up
                  of students, inside the university by shooting tear gas and
                  rubber bullets on those who attempted to leave. Hundred
                  protesters were trapped inside a university for consecutive
                  days as police laid siege to the campus. More than 1,100
                  mostly young activists were arrested in what was widely seen
                  as the police’s first major success against the movement.
                  After the siege ended, during a two-day search of the campus,
                  investigators found nearly 4,000 firebombs on the campus,
                  among other weapons, such as other explosive items and bottles
                  of corrosive liquids.

                  Beijing says it’ll impose national security legislation on
                  Hong Kong, following the often violent anti-government
                  movements and protests last year.

                  security legislation on Hong Kong to tackle secession,
                  subversion, terrorism and foreign interference.
